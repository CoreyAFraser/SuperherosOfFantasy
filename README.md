<a name="pay"></a>
## Payment and Payouts
Given the large divergence from standard league play, this league will start at a $25 year dues, but in future years (post year 2) unanimous vote can modify the yearly dues. At start up each team will need to pay for the first two (2) years of dues in order to maintain insurance against a team needing to leave the league and to provide a fund for which to provide new owners an incentive to take over teams UNM. If the dues are increased the following year dues will require an additional payment of the difference between the old and the new dues to insure the “back up fund” remains solvent.


### Proposed Payout
(Note: $300 will be collected each year, MFL feels are $70 per year, so there will be $230 in the pool)

1st: :$120
2nd: $60
3rd/4th: $25

## Divisions and Play-offs

3 divisions of 4
3 division winners make the play-offs and top 2 records have bye (1st tie breaker is strength of schedule, 2nd tie breaker is points for)
Best record for non-division winner makes the play-offs (4th seed)
Most remaining VP (5th seed)
Highest scoring remaining team makes the play-offs (6th seed)

Play-offs start week 13 with a two week championship in weeks 15 and 16.

The divisions will be themed Marvel, DC, and “Everyone Else” (Image, Dark Horse, etc)
Please name your teams appropriately for your division and include a team image.

* Edit (4/14/2020)
** Clarification: VP is Victory Points. Your team earns one VP for each win it earns and will earn up to one additional VP per week for having a top 6 score. If there is a tie for 6th, both teams will receive a VP.

### Divisional Re-allignment

Re-allignment will take place every 2 years and be based on the statistics of the teams over the previous 2 years.

The two previous champions will be placed in division Marvel and DC, the team with the best remaining combined regular season record will be placed in division “EE”. In the case of a back to back champion, both divisions DC and “EE” will be placed by combined regular season records.

The team with the lowest combined potential points will be placed in division “EE”, then DC, then Marvel.

The remaining teams with the highest total points scored will be placed in division “EE”, DC, and Marvel in order.

The remaining three teams will be placed randomly.

<a name="rookie"></a>
## The Rookie Draft

The Rookie draft will be 4 rounds.

All rounds of the rookie draft will be slow draft. Rounds 1 and 2 will have 24 hour pick clocks, if your clock expires teams behind you may start picking, but you still have the ability to place your pick just like the NFL draft.

Rounds 3 and 4 will have slightly shorter 18 hour clocks with the same rules about running out of time.

Rounds 1 and 2 of the rookie draft will take place between 1 and 3 weeks after the NFL draft depending on scheduling, I will do my best to accommodate everyone’s schedules, but given that it is a slow draft I don’t foresee this being problematic.

Rounds 3 and 4 will take place after week 2 of the NFL pre-season

### Rookie Draft Order

Non-play off teams will be awarded the same draft position in each round by a “Points Race”.

Starting in the week after a team has been mathematically eliminated* each weekly total will add to a total. Teams will be awarded draft position in the order of most points accumulated to least points accumulated.

* Record and VP are fairly straightforward to figure out when a team is mathematically eliminated, but given that the last play off spot is done by points scored and calculating if a team is mathematically eliminated from that play off spot is difficult at best, this requirement for being eliminated will be ignored. If a team has been accumulating points for the “Points Race” makes the play-offs as the highest scoring team remaining, they are removed from the “Points Race”.



Play off teams draft picks will be awarded in the following way:
Pick 12 is awarded to the champion (Championship is weeks 15 and 16)
Pick 11 is awarded to the runner up (Championship is weeks 15 and 16)
Pick 10 is awarded to the loser of the 3rd/4th game (this match spans weeks 15 and 16)
Pick 9 is awarded to the winner of the 3rd/4th game (this match spans weeks 15 and 16)
Pick 8 is awarded to the loser of the 5th/6th match (this match spans weeks 14 and 15)
Pick 7 is awarded to the winner of the 5th/6th match (this match spans weeks 14 and 15)

There will be a "Toilet Bowl" held during the weeks of the standard play offs, the winner of this bracket will be awarded pick 2.07, pushing the rest of the 2nd round back by 1 pick. Seeding for the toilet bowl will be in reverse order of potential points with a tie breaker of lowest points against with the bottom two teams getting byes in the toilet bowl.

## Roster Expansion/Contraction

Just prior to the rookie draft each year, rosters will expand from 24 players to 30 players.
Rosters will contract 1 player at the end of each of the first 3 weeks of the preseason and 3 players after week 4 of the preseason has concluded.


If the commissioner issues a "warning" to a team that they have not adjusted their rosters to meet the appropriate number of players that team has 24 hours to contact the commissioner or to adjust their roster, if they fail to do so the commissioner will make the cut for that team. On the first infraction the commissioner will make a good faith effort to cut the player(s) who would most likely get cut. Subsequent infractions may result in less effort to determine the worst player(s) and multiple infractions will be met with a kind notification that your team is under new management.



<a name="waivers"></a>
## Waivers

During the off season waivers will run on Wednesday at 10 am EST and be determined by Blind Bid (FAAB). Off-season Budget is $100

During the season waivers will run Tuesday through Saturday at 10 am EST by Blind Bid. First Come First Serve (FCFS) FAs will be available post the Saturday waivers through the end of Monday Night Football. Players who are dropped will be available during the next waivers. In Season Budget is $600


<a name="poach"></a>
## Taxi Poaching Rules

The motivation is to encourage teams not to "hide" taxi eligible players on their taxi squads. The spirit of the taxi squad is to allow drafting of players who are less likely to be productive early and maintain their rights until it is more clear that they are either rosterable or not.

Each team has 1 successful claim allowed per year
Each team has one veto without penalty per year
Each team may only have one active claim
Each team may only have one active claim against them (If it is determined that 2 teams both make a claim against the same player within a short window of time eg 5 mins or less, the team with the lower standing will be awarded the claim)

To make a poaching claim, post in the group chat/league chat/email the league that you are making a claim. Name the player and the team.

The team now has 24 hours (exceptions can be made for extenuating circumstances) to activate one of 4 options.
1: Activate the player to the active roster
2: Negotiate a trade with the claiming team
3: Utilize their veto
4: Announce that the claim will not be disputed

If none of these are chosen in the 24 hour time limit, then the commissioner will process the claim. One exception is that if both teams make a request for additional time to negotiate a trade, in this case an additional 24 hours will be granted.

The team claiming the player has the named player put on their active roster. The team losing the claimed player is awarded a draft pick from the claiming team in the same round that the player was originally taken.

* Edit (4/14/2020)
** Clarification: A successful poaching claim is one that results in the claiming team acquiring the player either via a negotiated trade or the standard poaching process
** Note: If an owner is going to be unavailable for a period of time (Business Trip, Vacation, etc) please inform the league ahead of time and poaching against your team will be suspended until you are again available. Please don't overuse this clause. If its determined that someone is using this clause to avoid the poaching rules a warning will be issued.



<a name="matchups"></a>
## Weekly match-ups

Each team will play 2 other teams per week over the first 12 weeks of the NFL season.
Each team will play every team in their division three times and each other team in the league at least once (Note: you will play every non-division team aside from one, determined randomly, twice.)



<a name="unm"></a>
## Teams "Under New Management"

PLEASE don't let your team enter this state.
If there is an unfortunate situation where an owner is asked to leave the league, their team will be placed "Under New Management" (UNM).
This team won't trade or participate in waivers (unless they need a player to fill out a starting line up, they will always bid zero and drop the player lowest on DLFs most recent SF ADP)
Their line up will be set based on MFL's projections.
While any team is classified UNM it would be appreciated if league members participate in searching for a new and active owner.
When a new owner is found they will not pay dues for the first full year they participate.



<a name="tank"></a>
## Tanking

Please set your line-ups in a reasonable manner.

If an owner fails to set a lineup, they will receive a warning. I know this isn't baseball, but 3 strikes and you are out, the team will be placed UNM.



<a name="collusion"></a>
## Collusion

Don't do it, just don't. If I need to investigate this, we have a pretty big problem and likely all the teams involved will be immediately placed UNM. Collusion is a big deal.



<a name="trading"></a>
## Trading

Trading is encouraged, there are no reviews or vetoes or trade deadline.

Rookie picks for the next two years are available to trade, once a rookie draft starts the picks for this year + 2 will become available.


However if someone makes an accusation of collusion (please don't do this unless you have real evidence, this is a big deal) we will need to address it. If collusion is determined to have happened, then the actions will be reviewed to the best of my ability and as stated above, teams will be UNM.



If there are some really lopsided trades, I may reach out to the teams involved to find out what happened, mis-clicks happen. If both teams don't believe there was a mistake no action will be taken.


<a name="startup"></a>
## Start Up Draft

The Start Up draft will be slow auction style held prior to the NFL draft and will include rookie picks as auctionable assets.

Every team will have 3 available active nominations until the first 120 players are owned at which point each team will have 2 nominations until the next 120, a total of 240, players are owned afterwards each team will have 1. 

Each team will start with $250 in auction funds, all bids will be in whole dollar amounts and the minimum bid and increment will be $1. Remaining auction funds will be added to your waiver funds. Trades are not allowed during the start up auction.


<a name="rules"></a>
## Off season rule changes
There will be a period of time of time between the league championship and the second week of January where each owner will be able to submit proposed rule changes via the league message board. Proposed rule changes will need at least two other teams to confirm the nomination before a poll will be put on the league page, most rule changes will require 75% of the league to vote for the change. League members can discuss and ask for clarifications before and after confirmations are issued, if there are no ongoing discussions or clarifications then a poll will be posted 2 days after the 2nd confirmation. If there are ongoing discussions or clarifications, I will do my best to monitor, but I will need confirmations posted that clarifications and discussions are finalized as I don’t want to present a vote to the league prematurely.

Polls will last for 2 weeks or until it succeeds or fails (8 positive votes or 5 negative votes will end the poll). If there is a lack of participation, please just vote on the polls, then at the 2 week mark the percentage will be taken of the votes collected.


### Vote Requirements
At this time, I would suggest that the only votes that require more than 75% (8/12) votes to pass are league dues, which requires a unanimous vote (12/12) and actually requires everyone to vote. But I will take suggestions to add to this list prior to league start and I will amend this section.
